## Prompt 
Hey Chat. I need your help with an assignment. Here is the instructions: 
/**Assignment Instructions**/

And here is the original code: 
/**Input assignment 2 files**/

## Response

Here is a suggested restructuring of your intial product: 

CSVReader.java 
/**Intial version of the code**/

CSVWriter.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

ETLProcess.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

ProductRecord.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

ETLPipelineMain.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

This restructuring of the code utlizides the Single Responsilbility Principle and refactors each object to have it's own java class. Let me know if you need help coming up with Javadoc comments of writing your needed reflection documents.
