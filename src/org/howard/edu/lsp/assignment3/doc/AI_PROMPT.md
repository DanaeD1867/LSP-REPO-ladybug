## Prompt #1
Hey Chat. I need your help with an assignment. Here is the instructions: 
/**Assignment Instructions**/

And here is the original code: 
/**Input assignment 2 files**/

## Response #2

Here is a suggested restructuring of your intial product: 

CSVReader.java 
/**Intial version of the code**/

CSVWriter.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

ETLProcess.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

ProductRecord.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

ETLPipelineMain.java
/**Intial version of the code**/

Your final project should be structured like this: 
project-root/
├── src/
│   └── org/
│       └── howard/
│           └── edu/
│               └── lsp/
│                   └── assignment3/
│                       ├── ProductRecord.java
│                       ├── CSVReader.java
│                       ├── CSVWriter.java
|                       ├── ETLPipelineMain.java
|                       ├── ETLProcessor.java
│                       └── doc/
│                           ├── REFLECTION.md
│                           └── AI_PROMPTS.md
├── data/
│   ├── products.csv
│   └── transformed_products.csv

This restructuring of the code utlizides the Single Responsilbility Principle and refactors each object to have it's own java class. Let me know if you need help coming up with Javadoc comments of writing your needed reflection documents. 

## Prompt #2
Hi Chat. I need to compare and contrast the differences between the original and transformed file and was hoping you could help me expand on what I current have
/**Original version of project sumamry**/

## Response #2
Sure! Here's an expanded and polished version of your reflection that fits well within 1–2 pages and directly addresses all the required points: 

/**Modified version of the project reflection**/

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version, or if you want help tailoring it to a specific language or project detail!
